# PHY3030 - End-of-studies Project - Network Science - H17

This repository contains the work I have done for my end-of-studies project on network science during Winter 2017 at the Université de Montréal.

I learned a lot about the structure of various theoretical and real life networks, as well as the models with which those structures could be implemented. In the long run, I think network science can help us better understand the role of the architecture of a neural network in the process of learning. It seems weird that almost every real network (either man-made or found in nature) have a degree distribution that follow a power law (that is, a straight line when presented in a log-log plot), but no neural network has tried this configuration. This may be explained by the fact that neural networks are normally implemented without considering any growth, and that research to implement an optimization algorithm different from backpropagation is still an important research field (e.g. neural plasticity, genetic algorithms).

The project consisted of three parts : exploring theoretical models developed in network theory (the Erdös-Rényi model as well as the Barabasi-Albert model), using a web crawler to map a part of the WWW, and mapping my own Facebook friends network. The specifics of these three parts are explained in details in the final report (**report.pdf**). The codes used for these three parts are presented in their respective folders, named **##_\_Name\_of\_section_**.
